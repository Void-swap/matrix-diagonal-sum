## matrix-diagonal-sum

# Problem Description:
 You are given a square matrix matrix of size n x n, where n is a positive integer.<br> The matrix represents a 2D grid of integers.<br> Your task is to implement the function diagonalSum(matrix) that calculates the sum of both diagonals in the matrix and returns a list containing these sums.<br>

# Input:
 The input matrix is a square matrix of size n x n, where 1 <= n <= 100.<br> The elements of the matrix are integers.

# Output:<br>

 The function should return a list containing two integers:<br>
 The sum of the MAIN DIAGONAL (top-left to bottom-right).<br>
 The sum of the SECONDARY DIAGONAL (top-right to bottom-left).
